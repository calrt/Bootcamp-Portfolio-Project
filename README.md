## Target audience  

The target audience of this project is potential employers as well as other developers looking to connect. Images on the portfolio also include alt tags to improve accessability.

## Planning Process

- We were given 5 days to complete the portfolio from design to implementation, and deployment.
- I spent the first 2 days working on finding inspiration through the use of sites like Pinterest and then began working on the design based on this research.
- A key part of my decision making during the process was that I wanted to keep things simple so that I would be able to utilise my knowledge while also challenging myself through the use of new CSS technologies such as grid.
- I then spent the next 3 days working on creating the site using HTML and CSS while also tweaking my initial design so that it was as functional as possible. I also made sure that the design was responsive across multiple different screen resolutions.

I utilised Trello to ensure that I had broken down the project into achievable tasks.
