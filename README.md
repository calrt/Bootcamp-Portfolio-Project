## Target audience  

The target audience of this project is potential employers as well as other developers looking to connect. Images on the portfolio also include alt tags to improve accessability.

## Planning Process

- We were given 5 days to complete the portfolio from design to implementation, and deployment.
- I spent the first 2 days working on finding inspiration through the use of sites like Pinterest and then began working on the design based on this research.
- A key part of my decision making during the process was that I wanted to keep things simple so that I would be able to utilise my knowledge while also challenging myself through the use of new CSS technologies such as grid.
- I then spent the next 3 days working on creating the site using HTML and CSS while also tweaking my initial design so that it was as functional as possible. I also made sure that the design was responsive across multiple different screen resolutions.

I utilised Trello to ensure that I had broken down the project into achievable tasks.

### Additional Information  
  
Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)  
  
> In the 80s there was a limited network called the Internet Protocol (IP) that allowed computers to communicate around the world. However, it was not like the internet is today and was mostly intended for data sharing between scientists. In 1991 Tim Burners-Lee invented the world wide web which was a network of information accessible to anyway with an internet connection. Web browsers with GUI only became available in 1992 and from there more GUI web browsers became available and made surfing the web popular.  
>
> Dial-up internet came about in the early 90s and information was transferred over telephone line (meaning either the phone or the internet were able to be used at one time). From there newer technologies such as broadband and fibre optics have been developed to further increase the speed of data transfer and number of users on a single connection at any one time.

Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

> Domains are names assigned to IP addresses so that people can navigate to them easily. However, it is only through using a DNS that we can search for websites in a web browser and reach the websites IP address (and therefore see the content on the website). 
> 
> Web servers contain the content of a website (including file types like HTML and CSS) so that we can view them in our browser.

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)
> The introduction of 4G mobile internet has transformed how we use the internet today. Prior to 4G we were limited mostly to relatively slow 3G connections or wired or short-distance wireless connections through WiFi.  
> 
> Given that we have now been able to cut the cord, it has opened up the opportunity for us to use the internet and phones where ever. This has meant the ability for apps like Google Maps and Uber are now possible and also commonplace.
